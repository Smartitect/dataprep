# Stage 3 - Join Data

# ## Common
# So this is where we are trying to do all the common stuff to ingest all of the files.  Key is recognition that there are common patterns we can exploit across the files.
# NOTE - still to figure out how to do this from a single file and import it successfully.

#%%
# Import all of the libraries we need to use...

# ## Open PEOPLE and MEMBERS data flows from stage 2
# Simply pick up the data flows from stage 2...

# ## Join the PEOPLE and MEMBERS data flows
# Crunch time!  Let's see if we can get these cleaned up data sets to join.

#%%

# Weird, it doesn't come up with a suggestion despite having two MEMNO integer columns to work with!

#%%
joinedDataFlow.get_profile()

#%% [markdown]
# Just running a couple of checks now to see how well the join has worked:

#%%
print('PEOPLE row count = {0}'.format(peopleDataFlow.row_count))
print('MEMBERS row count = {0}'.format(membersDataFlow.row_count))
print('JOINED row count = {0}'.format(joinedDataFlow.row_count))

#%%
orphanedPeopleDataFlow = joinedDataFlow.filter(joinedDataFlow['MEMBER_PEOPLEID'] == None)
orphanedPeopleDataFlow.head(20)

#%% [markdown]
# ## Save JOINED data
# Finally save the JOINED data flow that comes out of stage 3 for consumption downstream

#%%
fullPackagePath = savePackage(joinedDataFlow, 'JOINED', '3', 'A')
print('Saved package to file {0}'.format(fullPackagePath))
